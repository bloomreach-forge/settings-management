## <span style="color:red">To be retired</span>

<div class="alert alert-danger">
This plugin no longer works when used on Experience Manager 14.1 and up, because of a refactoring of the Admin 
Perspective, see issue https://issues.onehippo.com/browse/CMS-11846.

Therefore, the plugin is no longer maintained and will probably be retired, unless a large community effort is
contributed.
