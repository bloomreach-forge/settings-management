## What is the Settings Management plugin?

The Settings Management plugin allows you to configure system settings, which are located somewhere in the repository.
Before you would have to dive into the Bloomreach CMS Console and browse to a specific location to change the setting.
This plugin is targeted towards admin users and webmasters, so that they can just change these settings from within the CMS UI.

## Features

This plugin for now covers only some core Bloomreach CMS settings. However configuration screens for other 
plugins can be added to the settings management panel. See the [adding features page](adding-features.html) for more information.

## Code

Code is on GitHub at [github.com/bloomreach-forge/settings-management](https://github.com/bloomreach-forge/settings-management)

## How you can contribute
We need help with:
- Translating the labels and tooltips for each feature (de, fr, etc)
- A settings panel for your (forge) plugin
- Add more panels for existing parts of Bloomreach CMS
- Improve the UI of the existing plugins

See [this Bloomreach Forge GitHub page](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/development.html) on how to contribute.
